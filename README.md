## üéØ Inspiration

As an active-duty Navy Chief and advocate for veterans' welfare, I created **VA Rating Assistant** to help veterans navigate the confusing, time-consuming VA disability claims process. The goal: **Use AI and serverless technology to deliver fast, clear, and actionable disability rating estimates**‚Äîall through a modern, accessible web interface built in **Bolt.new**.

---

## üìå Project Overview

**VA Rating Assistant** is a web-based application that allows veterans to upload their medical documents and receive **AI-powered VA disability rating estimates**. The platform also offers tools for **pre-filling VA forms**, **finding nearby VA facilities**, and **tracking conditions over time**.

- **Frontend:** Built entirely in **Bolt.new (React + TypeScript)**.
- **Backend:** Fully serverless, running on **AWS Lambda**, with integrations to **S3**, **Textract**, **Bedrock**, **SQS**, **SNS**, **API Gateway**, and **X-Ray**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend (Built Entirely in Bolt.new)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Bolt.new (React + TypeScript)** | Full user interface, state management, routing, and API consumption |
| **Built with Bolt Badge** | Displayed proudly on the deployed site |

---

### Backend (AWS Services)

| AWS Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **AWS Lambda** | Core serverless compute for all backend functions |
| **Amazon API Gateway** | Public API layer for Bolt frontend to connect with Lambda functions |
| **Amazon S3** | Secure storage for uploaded medical documents |
| **Amazon Textract** | OCR for text and data extraction from PDFs and images |
| **Amazon Bedrock + Bedrock Agent** | AI and RAG-driven disability condition analysis |
| **Amazon SQS / SNS** | Asynchronous event handling for large document jobs |
| **Supabase (Powered by AWS)** | User authentication and authorization |
| **AWS X-Ray** | Distributed tracing and backend monitoring |

## ‚úÖ How We Used AWS Lambda

**AWS Lambda is the core backend engine of VA Rating Assistant.**  

Here's how Lambda fits in:

1. **API Endpoints:**  
Every backend feature‚Äîdocument upload processing, Textract calls, Bedrock AI triggers, condition mapping‚Äîis executed within AWS Lambda functions, triggered via **Amazon API Gateway**.

2. **Event-Driven Workflows:**  
When users upload documents from the Bolt frontend, S3 events trigger **Lambda** functions for **Textract processing** and **AI analysis**.

3. **AI Workflow Orchestration:**  
Lambda functions coordinate between **Textract**, **Bedrock**, and **Supabase** for extracting, analyzing, and saving disability-related data.

4. **Scalable and Stateless:**  
All Lambda functions run in a fully stateless, scalable manner, perfectly aligned with the **serverless-first architecture** of this project.

## üöß Challenges I Overcame

- **Document Variability:**  
Dealing with a wide range of file types (PDFs, scanned images, handwritten notes).

- **AI Accuracy:**  
Tuning **Bedrock RAG workflows** to align extracted medical conditions with **38 CFR VA disability rating criteria**.

- **Scaling for Large Documents:**  
Using **SQS/SNS** and **chunked Lambda workflows** to process large uploads without timeouts.

- **User Trust & Security:**  
Implementing **end-to-end encryption** and adhering to **HIPAA-conscious practices** for sensitive veteran data.

---

## üèÜ Accomplishments

- **Built Entire Frontend in Bolt.new:**  
From wireframes to production, Bolt was the core platform for all user-facing pages, state management, and API interactions.

- **Fully Serverless Backend:**  
Every backend component runs on **AWS Lambda**, triggered by **API Gateway**, **S3 Events**, and **SQS/SNS pipelines**.

- **AI-Powered Disability Rating Estimator:**  
Using **Textract**, **Bedrock**, and **custom RAG agents** to map medical findings to VA rating estimates.
